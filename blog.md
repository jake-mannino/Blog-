## **Week One January 29th**
### 1. I wasn't really sure what to expect in week one. Looking back I think that the amount of information was overwhelming at first, but I got more comfortable as I worked through the projects and courses online I found I was able to compartmentalize everything better and feel less intimidated by it.
### 2. This week was an adjustment for me. I struggled some with effeciently organizing how I studied and processed all the information. Also was working more this week so I think asking my boss for more hours off to focus better on this bootcamp will make a difference. Going forward I not only want to make more time in my day for absorbing all this information and practice applying it, but I also make a more structured, effecient and effective study routine. Visual aids and actually doing more rather than just reading and watching helps since I'm more of a kinesthetic learner. Also prioritizing tasks so I don't get lost and waste time trying to fully understand something that is more tangential to the main objectives of the week.
### 3. I'm excited to learn more about block-chain coding languages, particulary like Javascript and Python since they're so universal, and I'm also excited to build more confidence and gain momentum in making my studying and practicing more structured and efficient in the coming weeks.
